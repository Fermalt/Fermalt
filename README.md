### Hey !

Here are the different technologies i'm using in my projects :

# 🖥️ Web and mobile development :
- Java and Kotlin💛 (worst language i like to use) and sometimes a bit of python
- Html/css/javascript (typescript) + frameworks (angular, react, next.js)
- SQL, Hibernate for databases

# 📊 Excel development :
- VBA
- SQL for informations flows


# Projects :
- Currently working on a small mobile memory game available to everyone. The main objective of this game is to help our olders to train their brain !
- ScaleApp : A web platform where developers and testers can meet up. Augmented with a discord bot to simplify testers management. (https://scale-app.net)

I've got (bad) experiences of php 😭
